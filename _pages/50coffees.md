The motivation behind this project is to engage into meaningful conversations, absorb diverse experiences, weave compelling stories, learn a bit and a bit of networking too (a concept I never fully understood). Additionally, the goal is to discover and refine my own voice as I listen to your stories. Initially, the focus will be on individuals within my industry, with the eventual intention of expanding to include related fields.
