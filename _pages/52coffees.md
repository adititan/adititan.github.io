My motivation behind this project is to engage into meaningful conversations, take in diverse experiences, weave compelling stories, may be learn a thing or two and take a crack at this whole networking thing. The goal is also to discover and refine my own voice as I listen to your stories, one coffee at a time. The plan is to initially focus on people within my industry, with the eventual intention of expanding into related fields.

#### Here's the Coffee Chat Rundown:
Step 1: Let's set up a meet-up, in-person or virtual.
Step 2: I'll craft some questions based on your background and some LinkedIn magic.
Step 3: The coffee's on me. We dive into a chat that's all about the fun.
Step 4: Post-chat, my pen gets to work, and your story takes the spotlight on this corner of the internet.
